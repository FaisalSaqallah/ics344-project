### 🧨 Phase 1: Attack Simulation
Performed SSH brute-force attack using Metasploit.

### 📊 Phase 2: Log Analysis
Configured Splunk to collect logs from attacker/victim and visualize activity.

### 🛡️ Phase 3: Defense
Implemented Fail2Ban, disabled SSH, and validated protection by repeating the attack.
